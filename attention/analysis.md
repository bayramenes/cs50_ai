## Layer 6, Head 2

when given a sentence that has an adjective that describes the masked word we can see that it draw a strong relationship between
the adjective and the masked word

Example Sentences:
- she sat on the red [MASK] and relaxed
- he looked at the black [MASK] and was shocked

## Layer 6, Head 7

we can see that this attention head somewhat captures the relationship between the verb (sat,looked) and the prepositions (on,at)
in the second example it is a little bit more noisy though we can still safely assume that this is somewhat the case

Example Sentences:
- she sat on the red [MASK] and relaxed
- he looked at the black [MASK] and relaxed
